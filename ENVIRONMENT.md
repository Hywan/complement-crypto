## Complement-Crypto Configuration
Complement is configured exclusively through the use of environment variables. These variables are described below. Additional environment variables can be used, and are outlined at https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/blob/main/ENVIRONMENT.md 

#### `COMPLEMENT_CRYPTO_TCPDUMP`
If 1, automatically attempts to run `tcpdump` when the containers are running. Stops dumping when tests complete. This will probably require you to run `go test` with `sudo -E`. The `.pcap` file is written to `tests/test.pcap`.  
- Type: `bool`
- Default: 0

#### `COMPLEMENT_CRYPTO_TEST_CLIENT_MATRIX`
The client test matrix to run. Every test is run for each given permutation. The default matrix tests all JS/Rust permutations _ignoring federation_. Valid values are: - `j`: Run a JS SDK client on hs1. - `r`: Run a Rust SDK FFI client on hs1. - `J`: Run a JS SDK client on hs2. - `R`: Run a Rust SDK FFI client on hs2. TODO: needs additional SS proxy / postgres. For example, for a simple "Alice and Bob" test: - `rj,rr`: Run the test twice. Run 1: Alice=rust, Bob=JS. Run 2: Alice=rust, Bob=rust. All on HS1. - `jJ`: Run the test once. Run 1: Alice=JS on HS1, Bob=JS on HS2. Tests federation.  
- Type: `[][]ClientType`
- Default: jj,jr,rj,rr

#### `COMPLEMENT_CRYPTO_WRITE_CONTAINER_LOGS`
If 1, writes container logs to ./tests. Useful as a debugging tool.  
- Type: `bool`
- Default: 0
